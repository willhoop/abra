## The working rule

**A mechanic is not open work until a probe fails on it.** Everything in the generated block above
came out of an artifact; anything in the hand list below is a claim about the engine that nothing
checks. The job of that list is to empty itself — each item becomes a probe in
`tests/test-mechanics.js`, and from then on the census carries it and the line disappears from here.

That is the whole reason the census count may never fall: it is the only number in the project that
a human cannot quietly soften.

## Hand list — found by differential testing, not yet probed

These were seen against Showdown but have no probe, so they are invisible to the census. Write the
probe first, watch it fail, then fix.

**This list is now empty except for Rivalry, which is the only entry that has never been probeable.**
Ten items left it on 2026-08-04 by becoming probes — Freeze-Dry, Haze, Friend Guard, Poison Touch,
Gigaton Hammer, Expanding Force, Marvel Scale, Disguise, Foul Play and Dry Skin's Fire
vulnerability. Disguise, Foul Play and Dry Skin have since been FIXED; the other seven are red in the
census, which now carries them.

- **Rivalry** — x1.25 into the same gender, x0.75 into the opposite, x1.0 if either is genderless.
  Wholly absent. Blocked on data, not on will: `MC.mons` carries no gender and `buildMon` returns
  none, and `data/engine-data.js` belongs to MEASURE. Its `damageBoost` tag carries a bare
  `mult:1.25` with no condition and 43 other members including Blaze 1.5 and Slow Start 0.5, so it
  cannot be wired from the artifact as it stands. The differential can no longer see it either:
  CONTROL FIX 6 sets `gender:'N'` on both sides, because `gender:''` made Showdown roll one off the
  battle seed and MEDICHAM has none — a seed-dependent x0.75 nothing could match.

## The three ratchets — 2026-08-04, PRIORITIES #40 / #40a

All three were red **before** this session and two of them **crashed** rather than failed unless
`SHOWDOWN_PATH` was set, which is most of why nobody ran them. Both now exit **2** with one line:
*NOT RUN — set SHOWDOWN_PATH*. A check that crashes is a check that gets skipped.

| Ratchet | Was | Now |
|---|---|---|
| `test-mc-key` | RED, `medicham2-browser.js: 5 -> 7` | **GREEN**, back to 5. The two lookups were **removed**, not baselined |
| `test-effective-identity` | RED, 234 → 302 raw reads | **GREEN**, with 7 files **declared** and medicham2's declaration **pinned by an assertion** |
| `test-no-silent-failure` | RED, 53 new silent catches | still RED at **40**, and **none of them are in a file ENGINE owns** |

**`--update` was refused on all three, and that is the point.** Raising a ratchet is the opposite of
what a ratchet is for. `test-no-silent-failure --update` would have laundered 40 catches belonging to
MEASURE, SEARCH and OPS along with the 11 that were mine.

**The two mc-key lookups both went through `pasteKey()`**, this file's own resolver — the one the
test's header already names as working. `bringIn` normalised `switchInForme.becomes` by hand and then
indexed `MC.mons`; `oneMegaPerSide` wrote out the `-mega` suffix strip that `pasteKey` already does.
Neither was a behaviour change and both are strictly more capable (pasteKey has the flat rescan).

**`test-effective-identity` needed a third option, because it had only two and both were wrong.**
Leave it red forever, or `--update` and launder `rollout_leaf.js`'s real violation with the rest. So a
file whose raw reads are correct BY CONSTRUCTION now DECLARES that, with the reason, in the shape this
project already uses for `RAW-STORE-OK`. Three rules keep it from being a mute button: the reason must
be about construction, a declaration that can be pinned is pinned, and every declared file prints its
count on every run. **The ratchet was re-verified to still bite** by dropping a throwaway file with two
raw reads into `engine/` — it failed on it.

**All 67 of medicham2's raw reads were walked, not asserted.** 66 are live battle bodies this engine
constructed; the one exception (`norm2(set.ability)` in `buildMonFromSet`) reads a parsed SHEET, which
is the case the test itself names as correct.

**What the walk found is the part that mattered.** The construction claim was FALSE — see below.

## What verifying the claim turned up: two mega-ability bugs

Both are probed in `tests/test-mechanics.js`. Census **100 → 102 live**, nothing fell.

1. **`megaRowAbilityCase`.** 85 of the 318 `MC.mons` rows key a mega and store `ab` in DISPLAY case —
   `"Technician"`, `"Huge Power"`, `"Tough Claws"`. `buildMon` copied that through, and every ability
   test in this engine is a lowercase literal (`att.ability==='technician'`). A body built from its
   MEGA ROW carried exactly the right ability and **not one line of it fired**: Mega Scizor's Bullet
   Punch read **52 where Technician makes it 78**. It hid because the OTHER door — base row + stone —
   goes through `megaAbility()`, which returns from a lowercase hand-written map, and because
   `board.js` overwrites the ability with `effAbility()` before its own damage call. Only the
   mega-keyed door was wrong: `position_features.js`, `sets.js`, `winProb2` called with a mega name.
2. **`megaSheetAbility`.** `buildMonFromSet` read `declaredAb || megaAbility(...)`, so a paste of
   *Scizor @ Scizorite / Ability: Swarm* built a `scizor-mega` body running **Swarm**. A team sheet
   lists the PRE-mega ability; this is the mega ability gap living in the engine rather than in
   `board.js`, which had already fixed its own half at `board.js:964`. **Two engines disagreeing about
   a FACT**, which CLAUDE.md names as this project's most expensive failure. Only the branch that
   swaps the key to a mega row overrides the sheet — a non-mega set still lets a declared Rough Skin
   beat the dataset's Sand Veil.

**`tests/test-paste.js` was asserting the bug and its assertion was inverted.** It read
`geng.ability === 'cursedbody'` for a Gengar holding a Gengarite. Mega Gengar has **Shadow Tag** —
the worked example in `test-effective-identity`'s own header. Confirmed three ways before the line was
touched: Showdown's dex gives Gengar-Mega exactly one ability, `board.js effAbility` returns
`shadowtag` for the same sheet, and medicham2 now agrees.

**A probe was wrong before the engine was, for the tenth time.** The structural pin first reported
three megas with the wrong ability — Garchomp, Lucario, Absol. Champions ships a **second mega per
stone**: `garchompiteZ -> garchompmegaZ`, Rough Skin instead of Sand Force. The loop kept whichever
stone it saw LAST, which was the Z one. They are now excluded **with the reason**: `MC.mons` has zero
`-mega-z` rows and the store has zero `itez` occurrences, so the engine cannot represent them at all.

## The differential harness was silently dropping 12 rows, all of them the same Pokemon

Five catch blocks in `tests/test-engine-diff.js` returned a plausible `null` and said nothing, so a row
that failed to BUILD and a row that was never sampled were the same event. That matters here more than
almost anywhere: the headline is a RESIDUAL, and a silent drop shrinks the denominator without
shrinking the claim. Now counted, named and written to `data/engine-diff.json` as
`dropped_by_exception`.

Naming them earned its keep on the first run. At seed 20260804 `--n 400` it fires **12 times and all
twelve are Bellibolt**. The throw is inside Showdown: Electromorphosis's `onDamagingHit` adds the
`charge` volatile, and Charge's `onStart` reads a `source` that only the full move pipeline sets —
`moveHit`, the entry point this harness must use, leaves it null. **Not a MEDICHAM bug**, and on the
same layer boundary as the Disguise SUSPECT row, so it is recorded rather than papered over. It was
invisible until this session.

`tests/walk_tags.js` had the same shape and worse: its three silent catches returned `null`, and a
`null` prints as **NOT COVERED**, which the report calls "honest ignorance, not a pass". It was not
honest — an engine that THREW and a tag with no handler produced the same word.

## Found red, NOT mine, NOT fixed — reported rather than filed

- **`tests/test-tag-wire.js` is RED with 2 dead wires, and was red before this session.** Verified by
  stashing `medicham2-browser.js` and re-running: byte-identical output before and after. The two are
  `typeImmunity` (*"the absorbed hit HEALS the absorber 1/4 (1 -> 1)"* — Volt Absorb takes the hit and
  gains nothing) and `sealsMoves` (*"Encore pins the foe to its last move (undefined) for undefined
  turns"* — the wire exists at `medicham2-browser.js:1578` and its guard never passes). Both are
  ENGINE mechanics. Neither has a census probe, so **the census cannot see either of them**.
- **`tests/test-no-silent-failure.js` stays RED at 40 new silent catches, none in an ENGINE file.**
  `engine/status.js` 9, `rollout_r4.js` 5, `miltank.js` 5, `rollout_r1_artifact.js` 4,
  `rollout_explore_sweep.js` 3, `mag_bot.js` 3, `test-web-status.js` 3, `test-timestamps.js` 3,
  `run_stamp.js` 2, and one each in `rollout_r1.js`, `rollout_leaf.js`, `backtest_winrate.js`,
  `test-guru-derived.js`, `test-rollout-gates.js`. That is **MEASURE 33, SEARCH 6, OPS 3**. The
  `rollout_r4.js:312` the priorities file points at is in that MEASURE 33.

## Filed, not fixed

- **`engine/status.js` prints the differential count without its seed.** The artifact now carries
  `seed`, `requested`, `skipped_multihit` and `skipped_non_finite`; the print reads none of them, so
  "1/400 differential comparisons disagree" still looks unconditional and does not say that 15 rows
  were skipped as not-comparable. `status.js` is MEASURE's file. One line.
- **The last differential row is a LAYER MISMATCH, not an engine bug, and it is flagged in place.**
  `chesnaught woodhammer -> mimikyu` reads `showdown 0-0, medicham 120-130` and is marked SUSPECT.
  Showdown's `onDamage` returns 0 while the maxhp/8 never lands, because this harness never calls
  `battle.update()`; MEDICHAM's `dmgRange` correctly reports raw damage because WIRE 23 substitutes
  one level up in the battle loop. Both engines are right and the comparison is asking `dmgRange` a
  question about `battleTurn`. It is still COUNTED in the residual — flagging must never move the
  number. Fixing it properly means teaching the harness to run the damage-layer abilities, which is
  a bigger change than the row is worth.
- **`battleResult` cannot tell a finished battle from an expired clock.** `medicham2-browser.js:1802`
  scores bodies-then-HP unconditionally; `battleOver` returns true for a wipeout *and* for
  `S.turn >= maxTurns`, and the caller cannot distinguish them from the return value. Every
  cap-expired playout is therefore a material count returned as a win probability, silently.
  Filed by SEARCH 2026-08-04 while testing whether that was the cause of the flat leaf calibration.
  **It is not** — measured by wrapping `battleResult` over 1.1M playouts, 99.5–99.8% end by an actual
  wipeout at every explore setting and at horizons 20 and 60, and cap-hits run 0.2–0.5%. So this is a
  latent hazard, not a live defect, and it is filed rather than ranked. The cheap fix is for
  `battleResult` to return the reason beside the score so a caller can weight or discard those rows;
  do not change what it *scores*, which several artifacts depend on.

## The authorised list — ALL LANDED, 2026-08-04

Cleared after the SEARCH explore sweep and the leaf calibration landed. Census **42 → 100 live**,
differential **4/400 → 1/400** at seed 20260804, refit edge still CLEAN (all 58 feature columns
hash-identical, so no refit is owed).

**The item ranked first was not a bug.** `redirects` (7,240 uses) was filed as "the attack VANISHES
— the worst bug in the repo". It does not. The probe aimed **Dragon** Claw at **Whimsicott**, which
is Grass/**Fairy** and immune to Dragon: Follow Me fired correctly, pulled the attack off Incineroar,
and landed it on a body that takes exactly zero. Both arms read 0 and the conclusion was written from
that. Re-staged with Milotic the same code reads `aimed 0 / redirector 101`. Follow Me and Rage
Powder have always worked, so **no rollout, H2H, R3 or R4 result is invalidated by this** — the
blast-radius note attached to the original filing should be retracted.

Nine probes in this file have now been wrong before the engine was, and this is the first that was
believed. A red probe is a QUESTION.

| # | Item | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | ~~`redirects`~~ → **`redirectsType`** (Lightning Rod, 1,901) | **LANDED** (WIRE 25). The real redirection gap: the engine only looked for the Follow Me volatile, so an Electric move aimed past a Lightning Rod hit its partner. Probe now reads `aimed 0 / rod 0 / spa +1` — the rod both draws and absorbs, and the boost is the receipt. |
| 2 | **`drain`** (8,553) | **LANDED** (WIRE 19). `dealt 51 → user 85→110`. The fraction did not exist in the artifact: the tag said `readFrom:"m.drain"`, a pointer into a dex this engine does not have. `tag_dex.js` now emits the value, so Draining Kiss gets its 3/4 instead of an assumed 1/2. |
| 3 | **`multiHit`** (4,655) | **LANDED** (WIRE 20). `expectedHitsOf()` already existed and only `punishExposure` read it. Rock Blast 17 → 52. The differential now SKIPS multi-hit moves — comparing an expectation against one sample is not a comparison — so `tests/test-mechanics.js` is the only guard and says so in its own comment. |
| 4 | **`choiceLock`** (5,886) | **LANDED** (WIRE 24), in medicham2 — **no `board.js` change was needed**. `chooseAction` had honoured the lock since WIRE 18; `_a = forced \|\| chooseAction(...)` let every caller-supplied action through. A switch is still legal, which is the half a naive fix breaks. |
| 5 | **`fixedDamage`** (1,122) | **LANDED** (WIRE 21). Super Fang, Final Gambit, Endeavor and the OHKOs had no base power, so `hasPower()` rejected them and they were worth zero. Counter/Mirror Coat/Metal Burst need turn state a pure pricing function is not given, and are left at zero **loudly** rather than approximated. |
| 6 | **Foul Play** (734) | **LANDED**. `dmgRange` read `statSwap` (Body Press, Psyshock) and nothing had ever read `swapsStat.offensiveFrom`. The target's Attack **stage** moves with it, or a Swords Dance matchup — where the move is actually played — becomes a new wrong number. Differential: both directions now rel **0.0%**. |
| 7 | **`immuneToMoveClass`** (Soundproof 349, Overcoat 240, Bulletproof 85) | **LANDED** (WIRE 22) **with** CONTROL FIX 10 in the same pass, as required. Membership printed first: five abilities, and `magicbounce`/`reflectable` is excluded deliberately — it bounces status moves and grants no damage immunity. Powder is left to `powderBlocked()`, which already owns that question. |
| 8 | **Disguise** | **LANDED** (WIRE 23). Exactly `maxhp/8`, not a flat zero. My probe's own threshold (`≤15% of the real hit`) would have **rejected** the correct fix — 16 against a 92 hit is 17% — so the assertion was corrected to the exact rule first. The busted flag is deliberately NOT cleared on switch-out. |
| 9 | **Dry Skin Fire x1.25** | **LANDED** — tag first, exactly as specified. `tag_dex.js` now probes `onSourceBasePower` beside the stat route; membership printed before wiring matched **exactly one** ability corpus-wide. The four hardcoded `thickfat/heatproof/purifyingsalt/waterbubble` lines in `dmgRange` are gone, replaced by one tag-driven read. Differential: `houndoom fireblast -> heliolisk` now rel **0.0%**. |
| — | `train_policy.js` `writeWeights` provenance | STILL NOT DONE. Carried from the previous pass. |

**Regenerating `data/tags.json` was verified, not assumed.** The generator did **not** reproduce its
own artifact on the first run — 285 entries differed. Every one of those was the `uses` count alone,
because the store grew mid-session; after excluding `uses`, exactly **9** entries changed and all 9
were the intended ones (8 drain moves + `dryskin`). No feature reads `.uses`, and
`feature_fixture --check` is clean afterwards. Anyone regenerating tags should run that same diff
rather than trusting the file.

**The mechanism in item 5 was diagnosed wrongly first and the correction matters.** A starved
`basePowerCallback` does compute NaN, but Showdown clamps before it reaches the target's HP, so the
row comes back as a clean, plausible, entirely fake **zero** — not a NaN. A `Number.isFinite` guard
therefore does *not* catch it and has never fired on this corpus; the guard is kept and says so in
its own comment, and the phantom zero is caught by the SUSPECT marker instead. A fix aimed at the
wrong mechanism is still a bug.

## Ranked engine fixes — every one has a red probe behind it

The 2026-08-04 tag walk added 88 probes and moved the census from 54 probed to 142. `live` went
42 → 100 and `missing` from 12 to 42, and not one previously-live probe fell. Nine of the entries
below have since LANDED (see the authorised list above); what remains here is the queue. Ranked by corpus uses, then by how badly wrong the
behaviour is, with Lesson 3 applied by hand.

**Nine of these were my probe being wrong, not the engine, and each was caught by its own control
before it reached this list** — a spread move aimed where a single-target one was needed, Close
Combat fired at a Ghost that is immune to it, Toxic fired at a Steel that cannot be poisoned, and a
Fly declared by a Pokemon slower than its attacker (which the real game also lets through). That is
Lesson 5 for the sixteenth-through-nineteenth time, and it is why every probe here prints BOTH arms.

1. **`redirects` — 7,240 (Rage Powder 5,874, Follow Me 1,366). Take this first, and not for the
   usage.** The failure is worse than absence: the attack *vanishes*. Probe reads
   `no Follow Me: aimed 92 / partner 0 | Follow Me: aimed 0 / partner 0` — nobody takes it. Every
   Rage Powder in every rollout ever run has been a free team-wide Protect, and the searcher
   maximises exactly the lines its model is most optimistic about (Lesson 2). `redirectsType`
   (Lightning Rod, 1,901) is the same bug through a different door and reads the same way.
2. **`drain` — 8,553 (Matcha Gotcha 4,957, Giga Drain 1,255, Drain Punch 916, Draining Kiss 814).**
   `move dealt 51 to the foe; user 85 -> 85 hp`. The damage lands and the heal is dropped, so the
   most-clicked recovery route in the format is worth nothing.
3. **`choiceLock` — 5,886.** Not unimplemented: `tests/test-choice-lock.js` asserts it four ways and
   passes, on `board.js`. MEDICHAM obeys whatever action it is handed. Two engines disagreeing about
   a FACT is the CLAUDE.md rule this project has broken most expensively.
4. **`multiHit` — 4,655 (Dual Wingbeat 2,675, Twin Beam 676, Triple Axel 522, Population Bomb 385).**
   Priced as ONE hit. Dual Wingbeat is exactly half its real damage; Population Bomb about a seventh.
   The differential cannot see this — single-call `moveHit` also hits once — so only the probe can.
5. **`blocksSoundMoves` — 2,726 (Throat Chop).** One move, all real clicks, no effect at all.
6. **`punishesContact` — 1,761 (Spiky Shield 887, Baneful Bunker 698, King's Shield 176).** The block
   works and the punish does not, so the three are currently just Protect.
7. **`swapsStat` / Foul Play — 734, and the only red item with an independent authority behind it.**
   Confirmed twice against Showdown in the same run and in BOTH directions —
   `spiritomb foulplay -> wyrdeer` 178 there against 132 here, `klefki foulplay -> pangoro` 19
   against 8. `dmgRange` reads the `statSwap` tag, which Foul Play does not carry; its `swapsStat`
   params say `offensiveFrom:"target"` and nothing reads that field.
8. **`overridesEffectiveness` / Freeze-Dry — 1,252.** `mrrime freezedry -> araquanid` reads 96-114 on
   Showdown and 24-28 here: the full 4x, the move's entire identity, and independently confirmed.
9. **`fixedDamage` — 1,122 (Super Fang 577, Final Gambit 250, Endeavor 93).** `mv.bp=0`, so
   `dmgRange` short-circuits and these moves are worth literally zero to the engine.
10. **`boostsEachTurn` — 1,137 (Speed Boost 700, Moody 434)** and **`healsOnSwitchOut` — 1,057
    (Regenerator 830).** Both sheet counts, but both fire on a schedule rather than on a condition,
    so the count is close to the real rate.
11. **`costsUserHP` — 929 (Substitute 528).** Resolves to `kind: affect` and costs nothing;
    Substitute is not modelled at all and the HP cost is only its visible half.
12. **`poisonsOnMyContact` — 947 (Poison Touch)**, **`reducesAllyDamage` — 875 (Friend Guard)**,
    **`immuneToMoveClass` — 838 (Soundproof 344, Overcoat 240, Bulletproof 84)**. Sheet counts, and
    Lesson 3 bites hardest on Poison Touch: it fires only on CONTACT moves, so a special attacker
    carrying it contributes to the 947 and never triggers.
13. **`clearsBoosts` — 542 (Haze).** `playerAction` resolves it to `kind: pass`, so Haze is a wasted
    turn in every rollout.
14. **`partialTrap` 772, `terrainScaled` 296, `cantUseTwice` 186, `untagged`/Marvel Scale.** Real
    but small. Infestation lands its 8 damage and then chips nothing at all; Spiky Shield (item 6)
    blocks correctly and then punishes nothing — both probes print which half happened, so neither
    can be confused with a move that never resolved.
15. **`formeChange` / Disguise — 111 sheet uses, and the count badly understates it.** Mimikyu
    appeared in three of the residual differential rows across four seeds, because every Mimikyu that
    appears at all uses Disguise on turn one. Note the artifact will not hand this to you:
    `disguise.tags` is `["preventsCrit","formeChange"]`, and `preventsCrit` also holds Battle Armor,
    Shell Armor and Ice Face.

**The second block, found by walking further down the same list.** Smaller individually, and three
of them are whole categories of turn the engine cannot represent at all:

16. **`forcesSwitch` — 513 (Roar 400, Dragon Tail 96).** The move deals its 69 damage and the drag
    does not happen, so a phazing turn is priced as a weak attack.
17. **`noRecoil` — 731 (Rock Head)**, **`curesVolatile` — 665 (Mental Herb)**,
    **`blocksExplosion` — 545 (Damp)**, **`ignoresTypeImmunity` — 469 (Scrappy)**,
    **`reordersTurn` — 463 (After You 148, Instruct 162, Quash 153)**. All sheet or click counts,
    all read identical across the knob.
18. **`userFaints` — 338.** Explosion leaves its user on full HP. **`crashOnMiss` — 199**: High Jump
    Kick misses correctly and costs nothing. **`hazard` — 195**: the switch happens and Stealth Rock
    chips a 4x-weak Staraptor for zero.
19. **`typeBecomesMoveType` — 248 (Protean)**, **`ignoresDefenderAbility` — 212 (Mold Breaker,
    verified against a Levitate hard zero)**, **`blocksHealing` — 196 (Psychic Noise)**,
    **`curesStatus` — 208 (Lum Berry 175)**.
20. **`multiAccuracy` — 907 (Triple Axel 522, Population Bomb 385), and it hides a second bug.**
    Three 90% rolls compound to about 73%, and `moveAccuracy('tripleaxel')` returns **100** — so the
    printed accuracy is wrong before the per-hit rule is even considered.
21. **`alwaysCrit` — 274 (Flower Trick 216).** Same design question as `critRatioUp` below, not a
    separate decision.

**Two that are NOT one-line fixes, called out so nobody starts them by accident:**

- **`writesAccuracy` (987) and `accuracyMod` (927) are blocked on a signature.** `moveAccuracy(id,
  field)` takes neither the attacker nor the defender, so No Guard, Compound Eyes, Sand Veil and Snow
  Cloak have nowhere to be read from. Both probes clear their control — the No Guard one pins the
  roll at 0.9 against 80% accuracy, so the control correctly MISSES — and both still read identical
  across the knob, which by Lesson 5 means unwired rather than unimportant. Changing that signature
  touches every caller.
- **`critRatioUp` (1,139) may not be a bug.** `dmgRange` models no crit anywhere, so "Night Slash is
  priced above the same move without its crit ratio" is asking for an expectation the function has
  never carried. Decide whether damage is a crit-free min/max before treating this as work.

## Ordering the queue

`tests/mechanics_rank.js` ranks unread tags by corpus usage — use it, not intuition, and read the
result against Lesson 3: **usage counts are sheet counts.** Blaze reads 4,585 uses and is worthless
because 30 of 54 entries are a Charizard that megas into Drought on turn one. Ice Scales, Filter,
Aerilate, Prism Armor, Punk Rock and Ripen read zero.

The damage disagreements in the generated block are ordered by `uses` for the same reason, and carry
the same caveat.

## Before wiring a new derived tag

Print what it matched. Every derivation over-matches on the first try — `refusesStatusMoves` caught
Telepathy and Wonder Guard, `speedOnItemLoss` caught Sticky Hold, `failsIfTargetNotAttacking` caught
Quick Guard, Wide Guard and Round. See `docs/LESSONS.md` §4.

## Done looks like

- The census `live` count is higher than it was.
- No probe that passed yesterday fails today.
- The differential test finds fewer disagreements **at the same `--seed` and `--n`**, or the same
  ones with smaller error. Quoting a residual without its seed is quoting a coin flip: the sampler
  used bare `Math.random()` until 2026-08-04, and two runs on identical source gave 6 and then 3.
- Nothing in the hand list above that has not become a probe.

**`missing` going UP is not a regression, and this is the one place the rule is easy to misread.**
It rose 12 → 42 on 2026-08-04 while `live` rose 42 → 100, because 88 probes were written for
mechanics nobody had asked about before. The number that may never fall is `live`. A rising `missing`
means the census stopped flattering the engine.

## The one thing this division owes the others

A **named engine release**. Fixes batch; the release is what triggers the refit and the restamps —
see [DIVISIONS.md](DIVISIONS.md). Landing engine changes continuously is what leaves SEARCH
measuring a build that no longer exists.
