Versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

**Rule.** Every change is logged here in the same pass as the code, together with the matching
updates to the white paper, the deck, and the technical documentation. A prior conclusion is never
silently rewritten; what changed and why is stated.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **ABRA is born**, split out from CHOMP as its own project: the Automated Battle Replay Analyzer.
  CHOMP stays the bring-4/lead-2 engine; ABRA is the meta-analysis brain that feeds it.
- **Durable, incremental, no-redo ingest** (`engine/durable-ingest.js`): pulls public Champions
  Reg M-B replays from the Showdown API (paginated, ~200 logs/sec, concurrent), stores every game
  raw and tagged — both teams' six, brings, leads, observed moves/items/abilities, result, both
  ratings, and a bot flag. Appends only new games (dedup by id). Tested on 1,501 real ladder games.
- **Analysis over the store** (`engine/analyze.js`): usage model at any rating cutoff / humans-only,
  plus a personal split by Showdown username. Writes `data/meta-usage.json` for CHOMP.
- **`ME` alias list** so a Showdown rename is a one-word edit, never a re-pull.
- `tests/test-parse.js` — 12 hand-derived checks on the replay extractor (teams, leads, brings,
  observed set fields, bot flag, rating, date).
- Governance: LICENSE (MIT), SECURITY.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, .gitignore, CI workflow.

### Validated
- High-ladder filter (humans, 1300+) reveals real signal distinct from the raw ladder — e.g.
  Kingambit 62% win, Incineroar 65% — confirming the tag-and-filter design earns its keep.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-22

### Changed
- **Reframed to its true scope.** ABRA is documented as the live-data platform whose purpose is to
  feed a simulator that models games and teams — a self-improving flywheel (collect → simulate →
  optimise teams → play with CHOMP → auto-ingest enemy teams → improve). CHOMP is one small early
  consumer, not the point. White paper §8 states the flywheel and the honest built-vs-roadmap status.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Simulator research white paper** (`docs/ABRA-simulator-whitepaper.md`): an MIT-level treatment of
  learning a VGC battle simulator from logged replays. Formalises the game (POSG, imperfect info,
  simultaneous moves), derives three modelling tiers with their estimators and failure modes, frames
  team optimisation and the self-improving flywheel, and grounds every claim in the 2025 literature
  (PokéChamp, Metamon, VGC-Bench, ReBeL/Player-of-Games, Sampled/Gumbel MuZero, offline RL). Names the
  model family in the CHOMP/ABRA tradition — **JOLTEON** (fastest, win-prob),
  **RAPID** (Rapidash, rollouts), **SLOWKING** (slow deep learned dynamics), **DITTO** (team
  optimiser) — speed of the Pokémon matches the cost of the model. Folds in CHOMP's pKO threat scoring
  as JOLTEON's features and RAPID's dynamics (grey-box modelling).
